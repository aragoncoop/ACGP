## Motivation for creating this ACGP

Membership onboarding can be more complex that it seems, we all have different and subjective opinions about who might deserve be part of the Aragon Cooperative, if we want to embrace collaboration as a core value for example, shall we demand a proof of collaboration? Or an sponsorship from a reputated member can work better? Maybe a combination of both?

We all love Aragon, but we know there are others governance tools with more functionalities and capabilities (yeah, they are all centralized, but at least we won't be managing funds there...).

Let's make a try and see how it goes, as an alternative, we still have [Luke's proposal](https://github.com/aragoncoop/ops/issues/1), we would have still to figure out how to *elect a membership committee*, I gues we could discuss it on the keybase channel or in a meeting (?). Anyhow, my proposal is the following:


## Description of desired ACGP and actions to be taken if any

To start using an oficial off-chain tool ([Loomio](https://www.loomio.org) to be specific) in order to agilize discussions related to decisions taking.

> Loomio is a simple, user-friendly online tool for collaborative decision-making. Loomio lets you host discussions online, invite the right people to participate, come to timely decisions and transform deliberation into real-world action. - [What is Loomio?](https://help.loomio.org/en/user_manual/getting_started/what_is_loomio/)

There shall be defined there, in a descentralized fashion of course, the rules for onboarding new members.

Deciding the onboarding/offboarding process shall be the first use case for experimenting with off-chain governance tools, depending on how it goes, we could extend use cases or forget about that at all.
