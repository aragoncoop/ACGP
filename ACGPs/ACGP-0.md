## Motivation for creating this ACGP

Every organization descentralized or not, needs a Cultural definition, a set of values and mindset that shall rationally and emotionally influence its membership so their behaviours can be oriented to a common value generation.

This Manifesto is being presented as a Minimun viable Manifesto that would allow our community to set the basics of our purpose to exist as well as our governance model.

## Description of desired ACGP and actions to be taken if any

# The Aragon Coop Manifesto

We are a community that is fundamentally **engaged** with the [Aragon Project](https://aragon.org/project), and are composed of individuals that decided to come together to cooperatively and collectively voice our visions of the future of the Aragon ecosystem.

We stand for **collaboration** as a prominent tool to reach [true decentralization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9_DcXKC-Cs) while generating genuine value within the Aragon Network and other communities at large.

We aim for **fairness** among ANT holders, the AA, developers, community members and users, within every interaction and/or fund allocation that could take place among them, we want to be defenders of the [Aragon Manifesto](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-0.md) and its [Code of Conduct](https://wiki.aragon.org/documentation/Code_of_Conduct/).

We strive to **experiment with governance models and new tools** to pave the pathway toward true freedom in this world. We will  start with democratic one person, one vote mechanism, but will also try other suitable mechanisms such as ones based on merit, reputation, delegation, prediction markets, quadratic voting, etc. -- adapting and evolving our own governance through time.

In a nutshell, the **Aragon Cooperative** aims to contribute not only to the Aragon Network with a grassroots approach but also to other ecosystems that want to embrace decentralization and autonomy within their organizational structures.
